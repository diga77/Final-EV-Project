## Important Considerations

### Range Prediction Accuracy

The predicted range can vary by ±15-25% based on:

- **❄️ Temperature:** Cold weather reduces range by 20-40%
- **🏎️ Driving Style:** Aggressive acceleration decreases efficiency
- **🛣️ Terrain:** Highways vs. city driving efficiency differences
- **🌡️ Accessories:** HVAC systems impact consumption
- **🔋 Battery Age:** Degradation occurs over charging cycles
- **🌬️ Road Conditions:** Traffic, wind, and elevation affect consumption

### Recommendations

- Plan long trips with charging stations in mind
- Precondition battery before departure in cold weather
- Monitor battery health regularly
- Use eco-driving modes for maximum range
- Refer to manufacturer specifications for accurate estimates

### AI Response Reliability

- AI provides informed recommendations, not guarantees
- Always verify against official manufacturer specifications
- Use AI insights as advisory guidance
- Consult experts for technical decisions
